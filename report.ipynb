    "## Introduction\n",
    "With e-commerce becoming more and more prevalent in todayâ€™s environment, businesses within this sector need to understand what factors influence a visitor to transform into a purchaser. Hence, a lot of current research is focused on real-time revenue predictors for these businesses. In this project, we aim to build a classification model to predict the purchase intentions of prospective buyers, and determine whether they will make a purchase or not using the available website usage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository called the Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset, which contains information about different users, such as the time spent in each web page and if that lead to a purchase or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of 12,330 rows of observations associated with 10 numerical and 8 categorical attributes. The dataset was formed so that each observation (session) would belong to a different user in a 1-year period to avoid any tendency to a specific campaign, special day, user profile, or period.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attributes in the dataset can be split into three categories: data related to the page that the user lands on, Google Analytics metrics, and user visit data. The 'Revenue' attribute determines whether a session ended in a purchase or not, and would be used as the class label for our project."
